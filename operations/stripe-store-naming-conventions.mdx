### Naming Structure

1. **Device**: Start with the device name (e.g., `wisepose`).
2. **Environment**: Specify the environment, such as `prod` for production or `prod_test` for testing.
3. **Client**: Add the client identifier. Use `stable` for general releases, or a client-specific ID like `baes1335`.
4. **Version**: End with the version in the format `major.minor.patch` (e.g., `1.3.0`).

### Example Names

Using this structure, here are some example names:

- `wisepose_prod_test_stable_1.3.0` - Internal Testing (Development)
- `wisepose_prod_test_baes1335_1.3.0` - Client-Specific Testing
- `wisepose_prod_baes1335_1.3.0` - Production Release for Client 2
- `wisepose_prod_stable_1.3.0` - Global Production

This format ensures that names remain clear and standardized across different environments and client configurations.
