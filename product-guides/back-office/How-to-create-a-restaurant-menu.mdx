## Creating a Menu Template for Data Extraction

> This section provides instructions for creating a structured spreadsheet template to standardize the process of collecting and extracting menu data from restaurants. By following these guidelines, consistency and completeness in the data will be ensured.

---

### Creating a New Spreadsheet

> To begin, open your preferred spreadsheet application (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets) and create a new file. Name the spreadsheet appropriately, such as "Restaurant Menu Data" or "Setup."

---

### Setting Column Headers

> In the first row of the spreadsheet, create the following column headers to capture the necessary details for each menu item:

 - **Category**
 - **Sub-Category**
 - **Item Name**
 - **Description**
 - **Choices**
 - **Add-Ons**
 - **Price**
 - **Notes**
 - **Status**

---

## Template Layout

> For clarity on how the template should appear, refer to the image below, which visually represents the layout of the spreadsheet.

---

### Category and Sub-Category

> In the **Category** column, specify the main groups of menu items (e.g., **Desserts**, **Beverages**, **Snacks**). The **Sub-Category** column is for further classification under each main category (e.g., under **Desserts**, list **Ice Creams**, **Mousse**, or **Cheesecakes**).

---

### Item Details

> Use the **Item Name** column to list the names of the menu items. In the **Description** column, provide a brief explanation, such as key ingredients or flavor profiles.

---

### Choices and Add-Ons

 - The **Choices** column should list any available options for the item, such as different sizes, flavors, or preparation methods.
 - The **Add-Ons** column is for specifying extra toppings or side items that can be added to the dish.

---

### Pricing

> In the **Price** column, enter the cost of the menu item. Some items may have a base price of $0.00, with final prices determined by choices.

---

### Additional Notes

> The **Notes** column is for any special instructions that may apply to the item.

---

### Status

> The **Status** column is used to track the progress of each item with a dropdown menu that includes the following options:
 
 - To Add
 - In Progress
 - Completed

## Subsections for Add-Ons and Choices

> Create a section in the spreadsheet for listing add-ons available for various menu items. Include the following columns:
 
 - **Name**: The name of the add-on (e.g., extra cheese, bacon).
 - **Price**: The price of the add-on.
 - **Status**: Track the progress of adding the add-on with statuses like "To Add", "In Progress", or "Completed".

 - **Choice**: The name of the choice (e.g., small, medium, large).
 - **Price**: The price associated with the choice (if applicable).
 - **Status**: Track the progress of adding choices with statuses like "To Add", "In Progress", or "Completed".
