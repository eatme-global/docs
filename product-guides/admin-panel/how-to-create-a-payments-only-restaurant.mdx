### Restaurant Details

> Now, fill in the basic restaurant information:

- **Restaurant Name**
- **Suburb**
- **Address**
- **Contact Number**
- **Mobile Number**
- **Latitude & Longitude**
- **Google Map Link**

> To find the latitude and longitude for your restaurant:

1. Open Google Maps and locate your restaurant.
2. Copy the URL and extract the latitude and longitude from it, as shown below.
3. For example, from the URL: `https://www.google.com/maps/place/Champion+Hotel/@1.3142633,103.8981148,17.14z/`, the **Latitude** = 1.3168913 and **Longitude** = 103.9004756.

### Configure Parameters

> Now, let’s configure some important parameters:

- **Delivery Radius (KM)**: Default: 10
- **Ping Radius (KM)**: Default: 5
- **Direct Delivery Radius (KM)**: Default: 10
- **Restaurant Preparation Time (Min)**: Default: 25

<Note>
**Note:** You can skip the **What’s New/Featured** and **Restaurant Category** fields, as these are optional.
</Note>

> A quick explanation:
- **Delivery Radius** determines how far you’re willing to deliver.
- **Ping Radius** is a zone around your restaurant.
- **Direct Delivery Radius** is the range within which the restaurant delivers using its own logistics.

### Restaurant Type

> Make sure to select **Payments Only**. This choice will disable the **Service Types** section, as it’s not needed for this setup.

### Service Types

For Mobile Service Types:
- **Delivery**
- **Pick Up**
- **Dine-in**

For Web Service Types:
- **Dine-in and Pick Up**

### Sales Team Information

- Choose the **Restaurant Category** (Default: 2).
