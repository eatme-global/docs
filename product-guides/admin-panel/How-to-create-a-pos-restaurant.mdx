### Restaurant Logo & Agreement

> You’ll need to upload the restaurant's logo and the agreement document:

2. **Agreement**: Upload the agreement from the sales department. If the document isn’t available, a blank PDF will work as a placeholder.

> To upload the agreement:

1. Click the paperclip icon.
2. Select the file.
3. Hit the **UPLOAD PDF** button.
