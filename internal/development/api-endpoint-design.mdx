## Introduction

When designing APIs, one of the key architectural decisions is choosing between generic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints and action-specific endpoints. This document explores both approaches, their use cases, and provides guidance on when to use each.

## Generic CRUD Endpoints

### Overview

CRUD endpoints follow REST principles and provide standard operations for resource manipulation. They typically use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) with resource-focused URLs.

### Standard Pattern

```plain
GET    /api/resources          # List resources
POST   /api/resources          # Create new resource
GET    /api/resources/{id}     # Get specific resource
PUT    /api/resources/{id}     # Update entire resource
PATCH  /api/resources/{id}     # Partial update
DELETE /api/resources/{id}     # Delete resource
```

### Advantages

- Follows REST conventions
- Simpler API surface with fewer endpoints
- Better code reusability
- Consistent patterns across resources
- Easier to document using standard tools
- Flexible for handling multiple update scenarios

### Disadvantages

- Less explicit about business operations
- Complex validation logic in single endpoints
- Harder to implement specific authorization rules
- May expose more functionality than needed
- Business intent can be less clear

## Action-Specific Endpoints

### Overview

Action-specific endpoints are designed around business operations rather than data operations. They explicitly name the action being performed.

### Standard Pattern

```plain
POST /api/resources/{id}/activate
POST /api/resources/{id}/deactivate
POST /api/resources/{id}/archive
POST /api/resources/{id}/publish
```

### Advantages

- Clear business intent
- Precise authorization controls
- Simpler validation rules
- Better audit logging
- Can optimize for specific use cases
- Easier to implement complex business logic

### Disadvantages

- More endpoints to maintain
- Potential endpoint proliferation
- Less adherence to REST principles
- May lead to duplicate code if not carefully designed

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use Generic CRUD When

- Operation is a simple data update
- No complex business logic involved
- Standard authorization patterns apply
- Operation doesn't trigger significant side effects
- Resource state is simple

### Use Action-Specific When

- Operation represents a specific business process
- Complex validation or business rules exist
- Precise authorization control is needed
- Operation triggers important side effects
- Clear audit trail is required
- State transitions need to be explicitly tracked

<Note>
  Choose the approach that best aligns with your business domain and team structure. Many successful APIs use a combination of both approaches.

## Real-World Example: Payment Processing System

A payment system that handles state transitions, such as marking payments as pending, completed, or failed, would benefit from action-specific endpoints:

```plain
POST /api/payments/{id}/authorize
POST /api/payments/{id}/capture
POST /api/payments/{id}/refund
POST /api/payments/{id}/void
```

This makes the business operations explicit and allows for targeted validation and authorization rules.
