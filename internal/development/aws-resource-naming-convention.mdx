title: 'AWS Resource Naming Convention'
description: 'Standardized naming conventions for AWS resources at EatMe Global'
---

## Introduction

This document outlines the standardized naming conventions for AWS resources at EatMe Global. Following these conventions ensures consistency, improved resource management, and better operational efficiency across our cloud infrastructure.

## General Convention

The common pattern for most resources follows this structure:

```plain
{group}-{env}-[{availability_zone}]-[{scope}]-{resource_name}
```

### Base Pattern Components

- Required fields are marked with `{}`
- Optional fields are marked with `[{}]`
- All lowercase letters
- Hyphens (-) as separators for most resources
- Forward slashes (/) as separators for certain services (ECR, Secrets Manager)

## Variable Definitions

### Group

- Fixed value: `eatme-global`
- Represents our organization identifier

### Environment (`env`)

- `dev` - Development
- `qa` - Quality Assurance
- `stg` - Staging
- `prod` - Production

### Region (`region`)

Supported regions:

- `us-east-1` - North Virginia
- `ap-southeast-1` - Singapore
- `ap-southeast-2` - Sydney

### Availability Zone (`availability_zone`)

Examples:

- `us-east-1a`
- `ap-southeast-1b`
- `ap-southeast-2a`

### Route Code (`route_code`)

- `public` - Internet-facing resources
- `private` - Internal resources

### Database Type (`db_type`)

- `mysql` - MySQL databases
- `postgres` - PostgreSQL databases

### Scope

Optional identifier for specific applications or services (e.g., `orders-api`, `payment-service`)

## Resource-Specific Patterns

### Compute Services

#### EC2 Instances

```plain
Pattern: {group}-{env}-[{scope}]-ec2
Example: eatme-global-prod-orders-api-ec2
```

#### EC2 Other Resources (Volume, Snapshot, etc.)

```plain
Pattern: {group}-{env}-[{scope}]-{resource-type}
Example: eatme-global-prod-orders-api-vol
```

#### Lambda Functions

```plain
Pattern: {group}-{env}-[{scope}]-func
Example: eatme-global-prod-order-processor-func
```

### Container Services

#### Elastic Container Service (ECS)

```plain
Pattern: {group}-{env}-[{scope}]-ecs
Example: eatme-global-prod-api-ecs
```

#### ECS Service

```plain
Pattern: {group}-{env}-[{scope}]-svc
Example: eatme-global-prod-orders-svc
```

#### EC2 Container Registry (ECR)

```plain
Pattern: {group}/{env}/[{scope}]
Example: eatme-global/prod/orders-api
```

#### Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

```plain
Pattern: {group}-{env}-[{scope}]-eks
Example: eatme-global-prod-eks
```

### Database Services

#### Relational Database Service (RDS)

```plain
Pattern: {group}-{env}-[{availability_zone}]-{db_type}-[{scope}]-rds
Example: eatme-global-prod-ap-southeast-1a-postgres-orders-rds
```

#### DynamoDB

```plain
Pattern: {group}-{env}-{region}-[{scope}]-ddb
Example: eatme-global-prod-ap-southeast-1-orders-ddb
```

#### ElastiCache

```plain
Pattern: {group}-{env}-[{scope}]-cache
Example: eatme-global-prod-session-cache
```

<Note>
  Consistency in naming conventions is crucial for resource management, automation, and cost allocation. Always follow these patterns when creating new AWS resources.
</Note>

## Best Practices

1. **Consistency**: Always follow the defined patterns
2. **Descriptiveness**: Choose resource names that clearly indicate purpose
3. **Case Sensitivity**: Use lowercase for all resource names
4. **Length Limits**: Keep names concise while maintaining clarity
5. **Scope Usage**: Include scope for application-specific resources
6. **Tags**: Complement naming conventions with appropriate AWS tags

## Mandatory Tags

All resources should include the following tags where supported:

- `Project`: The project or initiative
- `Environment`: The deployment environment
- `Owner`: Team or individual responsible
- `Cost-Center`: Financial allocation unit

## Change Management

Updates to these naming conventions require approval from the Cloud Infrastructure team and must be communicated to all development teams.

## Additional Notes

These conventions should be incorporated into Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates and enforced through automated compliance checks.
