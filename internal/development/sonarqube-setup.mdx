## Getting Started

SonarQube is our code quality and security analysis platform. This guide explains how to access and authenticate with our SonarQube instance.

## Access Methods

- Access SonarQube at: [https://sonar.eatmeglobal.org](https://sonar.eatmeglobal.org/)
- Two authentication methods are available:
  1. GitHub SSO (recommended)
  2. Email and Password

## Authentication Options

### 1. GitHub SSO

- **Eligibility**: Only for employees with EatMe GitHub Organization membership
- **Login Steps**:
  1. Navigate to [https://sonar.eatmeglobal.org](https://sonar.eatmeglobal.org/)
  2. Click "Login with GitHub"
  3. Authorize the application if prompted
  4. Set up your SonarQube profile on first login

<Note>
  GitHub SSO is the preferred authentication method as it simplifies access management and ensures account deactivation when employees leave the organization.
</Note>

### 2. Email and Password

- **Eligibility**: For team members without EatMe GitHub Organization access
- **Account Creation Process**:
  1. Employee requests credentials from their Team Lead
  2. Team Lead submits request to SonarQube administrators
  3. Administrators create account and provide credentials
  4. Credentials are securely shared with the employee

## Project Access

After logging in, you'll have access to projects based on your team membership and role. If you need access to additional projects, please contact your team lead or SonarQube administrator.

## Integration with CI/CD

SonarQube is integrated with our CI/CD pipelines. When you push code or create a pull request, code analysis is automatically performed and results are available in SonarQube and as comments in your PR.

## Best Practices

1. **Review SonarQube results regularly**: Make it a habit to check SonarQube analysis results for your projects
2. **Address code smells early**: Fix code quality issues as they're identified rather than letting them accumulate
3. **Use SonarLint in your IDE**: Install SonarLint plugin for real-time feedback as you code
4. **Include SonarQube links in PR descriptions**: Reference relevant SonarQube analyses in your pull requests

<Warning>
  Never share your SonarQube credentials with others. Each team member should use their own account for traceability and security reasons.
</Warning>

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues with SonarQube access or have questions about the analysis results, contact the DevOps team via Slack in the #devops-support channel.
